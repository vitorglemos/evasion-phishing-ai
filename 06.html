<clean>Due to the nature of their work, officers in the Directorate of Operations often live and work undercover. The show was first produced at the Off-Broadway Westbeth Theatre, running from July 30, 1990 to August 16, 1990. Joe Layton directedand choreographed, with a cast that featured Chuck Cooper, Lillias White, and Mamie Duncan-Gibbs.The Broadway production, directed by Michael Blakemore, opened on April 26, 1997, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it closed on June7, 1998, after 466 performances and 21 previews. Among the large cast were Pamela Isaacs, Chuck Cooper, Bellamy Young, Lillias White, and Sam Harris, winner of the first Star Search television competition in 1984. Choreography wasby Joey McKneely, scenic design by Robin Wagner, costume design by Martin Pakledinaz, and lighting design by Richard Pilbrow.[2][3][4]White (Featured Actress in a Musical) and Cooper (Featured Actor in a Musical) both won 1997 Tonyawards for their performances in this production.[4]The US Regional premiere took place at The Heights Theatre in Houston, Texas in April 1999. Directed by Ron Jones and choreographed by Jim Williams, with musical direction by StephenJones, the show featured Tamara Siler as Queen, Mia Fisher as Sonja, Illich Guardiola as Fleetwood, L.

The production will star Alexandra Grey as Queen, Antwayn Hopper as Memphis, Mykal Kilgore asYoung JoJo, Ledisi as Sonja, Erika Olson as Mary, Destan Owens as Old JoJo, and Ken Robinson as Fleetwood.[7]This means being discreet and selective about who they talk to when it comes to their career. Since covert assignments demandcertain skills, all officers in the Directorate of Operations go through specialized training when they join the Agency. The Life is a musical with a book by David Newman, Ira Gasman and Cy Coleman, music by Coleman, and lyrics byGasman.Based on an original idea by Gasman, the show explores the underbelly of Times Square's 42nd Street, inhabited by pimps and prostitutes, druggies and dealers, and runaways and street people in the era prior to its Disneyfication.The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. The books are read andenjoyed by children and adults alike and have also been made into hugely popular films.Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s stone I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loudfunny - the humour was. You usually need to read a Terry Pratchett novel to ensure constant laughter throughout but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.Hereis an example, with the ending being particularly good:As is told in The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins found the Ring a few hours after Gollum lost it, while he was alone in the caverns of the Misty Mountains. Shortly after discovering it,Bilbo came upon Gollum himself, who had intended to eat the lost Hobbit. Bilbo managed to get Gollum to agree to a riddle game to determine his own fate; if he lost, Gollum could eat him, and if he won, Gollum would have to show himan exit from the caves. Gollum lost the game but had no intention of letting Bilbo leave. He went to retrieve the Ring in order to use its powers of invisibility to help him kill Bilbo, but flew into a rage when he found it missing.Deducing that Bilbo had it from his last question— "What have I got in my pocket?"— Gollum chased him through the caves, not knowing that Bilbo had discovered the Ring's powers of invisibility and was following him to the cave's exit.At one point as he neared the exit, Bilbo was presented with an opportunity to easily kill Gollum, but relented out of pity for Gollum's wretched condition.Bilbo escaped Gollum and the Orcs that inhabited the Misty Mountains by remaininginvisible, and told a falsified account of his adventures to Thorin's company and Gandalf, claiming he had been very agile in the dark and escaped the goblins. Gandalf, who was also travelling with the Dwarves, was suspicious of Bilbo'sstory and of the Ring itself, which he immediately recognized as one of the Great Rings of Power due to the effects it had on Gollum's aging process.A few years after Bilbo's return to the Shire, Gandalf managed to coerce from Bilbothe real story of how the Ring had come into his possession. The truth was quite innocent, and so similar to Bilbo's fabrication that Gandalf saw no real reason why Bilbo would have lied about it in the first place, save perhaps toput his claim to the Ring beyond any possible doubt. Gandalf soon believed that the Ring had an "unwholesome" effect on its owner that set to work almost immediately, as it was not in Bilbo's nature to lie, particularly about somethingso apparently trivial. However, he saw no real danger in letting Bilbo keep the Ring despite the Hobbit's strangely possessive attitude towards it.In the sixty years that Bilbo had the Ring he seldom used it, although he kept it onhis person at all times. This lack of use meant its malign effects were slow to take hold, the most noticeable being that Bilbo retained a relatively young appearance even past 100 years old."Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudleyarrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often saidthat Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone: The Vanishing GlassThere are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people wehave met. Everybody knows or knew a spoilt, overweight boy like Dudley or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especiallywith his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizardingschool) he is not alone in being overawed:‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’There was a loud ‘Oooooh!”The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edgeof a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone: The Journey From Platform Nineand Three-QuartersThe One Ring, also known as the Ruling Ring, the Master Ring, the Ring of Power, and Isildur's Bane, was one of the most powerful artifacts ever created in Middle-earth, and by far the most dangerous. It was craftedby the Dark Lord Sauron in the fire of Orodruin, also known as Mount Doom, during the Second Age. Sauron's intent was to enhance his own power and exercise control over the other Rings of Power, which had been made by Celebrimbor andthe Gwaith-i-Mírdain with Sauron's assistance. In this way, Sauron hoped to gain lordship over the Elves and all other peoples of Middle-earth.Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all thedetail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could of gone to when they where eleven. And there many adventures befall the trio (Harry, Ron and Hermione) and the stone in thebook's title is centre to all that happens. The story builds towards and exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggestsurprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderfulsense of escapism. This book is highly recommended to anybody between the ages of 8 and 80.Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’sbook since The Hobbit.</clean>
